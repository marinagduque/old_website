My research combines novel theoretical insights with empirical analysis using methods like network analysis and survey experiments to address two distinct but complementary questions:
<ol>
<li> <strong>How do countries achieve status?</strong> While existing studies traditionally assume that status depends on attributes like economic or military capabilities, my work reveals the underlying relational effects that drive status recognition in the international system.</li>
<li> <strong>How does status motivate political behavior?</strong> While existing research treats status-motivated behavior at the state level as an attempt to achieve international recognition, my work disentangles the mechanisms driving status-motivated behavior at the domestic level.</li>
</ol>
