> How do states achieve status? Although we rely on status to explain important phenomena in international politics—such as wars and the foreign policy of emerging powers—we still do not understand what status is or where it comes from. Previous research treats status as a function of state attributes, such as wealth and military capability. Following Weber, I argue that status depends on social recognition: it concerns identification processes in which an actor gains admission into a club once they follow the rules of membership. Therefore, systematic social processes, which cannot be reduced to state attributes, influence status. In particular, status is self-reinforcing. Moreover, social closure influences status—which implies that (i) a state’s existing relations influence its ability to achieve status, and (ii) states recognize similar states rather than states with the largest portfolio of certain attributes. To investigate the determinants of international status, I move beyond ranking states based on attributes to examine quantitatively how status emerges from state relations. Leveraging inferential network analysis, I examine state practices that express recognition—specifically, the network of embassies. The analysis indicates that self-reinforcing dynamics and social closure, rather than state attributes directly, drive status recognition.

#### WORKING PAPERS

“The Logic of Expressive Rationality”

> States adopt seemingly disparate strategies to achieve status, such as increasing their military capabilities or adopting prevailing norms. Why do status-seekers behave the way they do? Although IR scholars usually explain behavior based on the logics of consequences or appropriateness, neither logic can adequately account for status-seeking behavior.  To explain status-seeking, I develop to a third logic of action---expressive rationality, whereby behavior expresses an actor’s desired group affiliation. Following this logic, high-status actors act as standard-setters, by defining the rules of membership for a club, and as gatekeepers, by deciding whether to admit aspiring members. On the other hand, status-seekers emulate the club with whom they identify. To demonstrate how expressive rationality can improve our understanding of international politics, I apply it to two different types of status-seeking behavior: weapons acquisition and norm adoption. I offer preliminary evidence that expressive rationality gives us additional explanatory leverage over instances of political behavior with consequential implications for international conflict and cooperation. Expressive rationality allows us study status-seeking behavior systematically, rather than treating it as an anomaly. Moreover, an expressive logic specifies how status-related processes help maintain international order.

“The Case for a Status Model of Recognition”

> When are power transitions violent? Anarchy-based theories cannot adequately account for peaceful transitions. Theories drawing on Hegel posit that misrecognition—treatment that contradicts a state’s self-image—causes war. Following an identity model of recognition (Honneth 1996), these theories tie recognition to self-esteem. Because it takes a psychological perspective, the identity model ignores what else is at stake during power transitions: the redistribution of privileges. Moreover, it ultimately cannot explain why states are recognized or not. I propose a status model of recognition (Fraser 2000; 2001) to analyze power transitions. Drawing on Weber, the status model takes a sociological perspective to define misrecognition as a form of institutionalized social subordination. In this model, emerging powers want to be recognized as equal partners in the management of the international order. Hegemonic wars happen when the great power club denies the emerging power the status of full member, and the privileges that go with it. In contrast, peaceful transitions occur when the great power club deems the emerging power to conform to the rules of membership, and therefore recognizes it as an equal. To understand power transitions, IR scholars need to consider the distributions of both identities and privileges among states.
