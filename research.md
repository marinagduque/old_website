#### WORKING PAPERS

“The Logic of Expressive Rationality”

- Winner of the <a href="https://www.isanet.org/Programs/Awards/THEORY-Conference-Post-PhD-Paper-Award" target="_blank">2019 Best Post-Paper Award</a> by the International Studies Association's Theory Section, for the best paper theorizing international politics by a post-PhD scholar presented at ISA 2019.

> While status is considered a fundamental motivation for political action, we still understand little about how it works as a motivation. IR scholars usually explain action based on the logics of consequences or appropriateness. Yet, status-motivated behavior often escapes either logic. To explain it, I develop a new logic of action---expressive rationality, whereby behavior expresses an actor’s self-identified group affiliation. Following this logic, action carries symbolic meaning, and social influence shapes behavior. Actors adopt the social conventions of the club with whom they identify. Moreover, high-status actors tend to act as standard-setters, by defining the rules of membership for a club, and as gatekeepers, by restricting access to resources and privileges. Insights from social scientific research support this view. I demonstrate the value of expressive rationality by applying it to a type of status-motivated behavior with consequential implications for international conflict: weapons acquisition. An expressive model focuses on the distinctive features of status-motivated behavior, and specifies the mechanisms behind that behavior. Expressive rationality allows us to study status-motivated behavior systematically, rather than treating it as an anomaly. More broadly, an expressive model opens new directions for research on symbolic politics.

“Signaling Status with Military Weapons: Experimental Evidence" (w/ Kathleen Powers)

> Why do states invest in costly weapons like aircraft carriers or new fighter jets, even when these weapons offer limited strategic advantages? Wilhelmine Germany built an expensive battleship fleet against their security interests, and more recently China directed vast resources into aircraft carriers while Australia purchased F-35 jets despite concerns about their efficacy relative to older models. Existing research suggests that advanced weapons appeal to status-seekers not only for their military functions, but because they symbolize membership in the club of modern states. Leaders may use weapons acquisitions to signal status to both domestic and international audiences. We conduct an original conjoint experiment with members of the American public to assess whether status considerations mobilize public support for weapons purchases. Using a conjoint design that controls for costs and strategic considerations, we test whether members of the public prefer to invest in weapons that are either a) described as exclusive, luxury goods or b) held by other high-status states. The experimental design allows us to disentangle status from strategic considerations and advance IR research on how status motivations affect foreign policy.
