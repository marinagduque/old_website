#### WORKING PAPERS

“The Case for an Expressive Logic of Action” _(under review)_

- Winner of the <a href="https://www.isanet.org/Programs/Awards/THEORY-Conference-Post-PhD-Paper-Award" target="_blank">2019 Best Post-Paper Award</a> by the International Studies Association's Theory Section, for the best paper theorizing international politics by a post-PhD scholar presented at ISA 2019.

> IR scholars usually explain action based on the logics of consequences or appropriateness. Yet, political behavior often escapes either logic. Extensive research finds that people's attitudes toward out-groups shape their positions on issues like international trade or immigration, which bolster support for ethno-nationalist populism in developed countries. In this paper, I argue that we need a new set of building blocks to theorize about phenomena like these. Combining insights across disciplines, I develop an expressive logic of action, whereby behavior expresses an actor’s social identification. Following this logic, group attachment provides a compelling motivation for political behavior, whose activation depends on an interaction between issue framing and psychological dispositions. People form emotional attachments to salient social groups, which political elites attempt to mobilize in connection with political issues; mobilization attempts succeed when issue framing taps into deeply felt attachments among group members in a given context. An expressive logic focuses on the distinctive features of expressive behavior and specifies the mechanisms behind that behavior. As such, it allows us to study symbolic action systematically, rather than treating it as an anomaly.

“Weapons of National Pride: An Experimental Study"

> Why do governments buy advanced weapons and put them on display for the domestic public? While weapons research emphasizes strategic factors, I draw from the nationalism literature to argue that weapons owned by high-status countries can become attractive as symbols of national pride, especially among citizens who identify strongly with the nation. I conduct an original set of experiments with members of the U.S. public to assess whether status considerations mobilize support for buying fighter jets. The experimental designs allow me to disentangle status from strategic considerations. I show that status considerations shape weapons evaluations even in a great power like the United States. When status motivations are salient, citizens may be willing to spend more on weapons that do not provide additional strategic advantage. As such, leaders can use weapons to boost national pride without paying the costs of war.

"Noblesse Oblige: Status Motivations and Support for Foreign Aid" (with Zachary Houser)

> What drives support for foreign aid provision? Conventional explanations posit that donors give aid for strategic reasons, to achieve domestic or foreign policy goals; or for altruistic reasons, to help those in need. In this paper, we argue that status can also motivate aid. Hierarchical relationships typically involve a sense of noblesse oblige, as privileged actors are expected to behave charitably towards the less privileged. Therefore, the more citizens value their country's international status, the more they should support foreign aid provision. Using two survey experiments in the United States, we show that respondents cued to consider that a reduction in foreign aid spending would hurt U.S. status are more supportive of foreign aid than respondents not cued to consider such an impact. Moreover, respondents are more supportive of foreign aid the higher their reported need for national status—whose substantive impact is comparable to that of the variables traditionally considered in foreign aid research. While previous research on status-seeking behavior focuses on conflict, our results suggest that status can also motivate international cooperation. In addition, the analysis indicates that framing foreign aid in terms of status can encourage richer states to help more those in need.
