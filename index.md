<img src="../images/DuqueHeadshot.JPG" style="width: 465px; margin-right: 25px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; border-radius: 0px" align="left"> I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at <a href="http://coss.fsu.edu/polisci/home/" target="_blank">Florida State University</a>. Before joining FSU, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University's <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/politics/" target="_blank">Department of Politics</a> and the <a href="http://ncgg-new.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance</a>, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the International Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy School’s <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs</a>, and the Managing Editor of <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/fsst20#.VcJd8DBViko" target="_blank">Security Studies</a>. I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from <a href="http://polisci.osu.edu/" target="_blank">The Ohio State University</a> (2016) and an M.A. in International Relations from the <a href="http://irel.unb.br/" target="_blank">University of Brasília</a> (2008). 

I previously worked in Brazil as a career diplomat in the Ministry of External Relations and an assistant at the Ministry of Defense. Working as a diplomat, I experienced firsthand the search for status: like other emerging powers, Brazil then strove to be recognized as an equal by the great powers. But while a growing scholarly consensus indicates that status lay at the root of important phenomena such as hegemonic wars, we still understand little about how countries achieve status or how status works as a motivation for state behavior. My research engages these crucial debates by drawing from an interdisciplinary body of work.
