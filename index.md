<img src="../images/DuqueHeadshot.JPG" style="width: 465px; margin-right: 25px; margin-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 5px; border-radius: 0px" align="left"> I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at <a href="http://coss.fsu.edu/polisci/home/" target="_blank">Florida State University</a>.
 

Before Joining FSU, I was a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton University's <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/politics/" target="_blank">Department of Politics</a> and the <a href="http://ncgg-new.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance</a>, a Postdoctoral Research Fellow with the International Security Program at the Harvard Kennedy School’s <a href="http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs</a>, and the Managing Editor of <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/loi/fsst20#.VcJd8DBViko" target="_blank">Security Studies</a>. I earned a Ph.D. in Political Science from <a href="http://polisci.osu.edu/" target="_blank">The Ohio State University</a> (2016) and an M.A. in International Relations from the <a href="http://irel.unb.br/" target="_blank">University of Brasília</a> (2008). I previously worked in Brazil as a career diplomat in the Ministry of External Relations and an assistant at the Ministry of Defense.

My research explores status in international politics. Working as a diplomat in Brazil in the 2000s, I experienced firsthand the importance of international status. Brazilian foreign policy was then explicitly concerned about status: like other emerging powers, Brazil wanted to be recognized by the great powers as an equal. Moreover, a growing scholarly consensus indicated that status lay at the root of important phenomena such as hegemonic wars. Yet, scholars and practitioners still do not understand what status is or where it comes from. My research engages these crucial debates by investigating the determinants of international status and its implications for the rise of emerging powers.
