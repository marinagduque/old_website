My research interests cover international and comparative political economy, with a focus on the politics of financial globalization and sovereign credit risk. During the 2017–2018 academic year, I will be a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the <a href="http://ncgg-new.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance at Princeton University</a>. Beginning in the fall of 2018, I will be an Assistant Professor of Political Science at <a href="http://coss.fsu.edu/polisci/home" target="_blank">Florida State University</a>. I received my Ph.D. in <a href="http://www.polisci.osu.edu" target="_blank">Political Science</a> from <a href="http://www.polisci.osu.edu" target="_blank">The Ohio State University</a> (2017).

My research examines why and how global capital mobility conditions national political and economic events in emerging markets. I investigate the determinants of capital market responses to political events and national policies, paying close attention to multiple forms of contagion in the global political economy. I analyze contagion dynamics from domestic to international investors in capital market reactions to politics, diffusion processes in governments' decisions to default on sovereign debt, as well as contagion in market assessments of government creditworthiness induced by investors' use of decision heuristics.

I was a Senior Fellow in the <a href="https://polisci.osu.edu/research/prism" target="_blank">Program in Statistics and Methodology (PRISM)</a> at Ohio State and have methodological interests in quantitative methods for the study of complex and dynamic interdependencies in political economy data, such as multivariate time series analysis, spatial econometrics, and social network analysis.

Prior to joining Ohio State, I was a Policy Analyst/Advisor at the Brazilian Ministry of Finance, where I worked on the negotiation of international agreements on trade and investment in multilateral, regional, and bilateral forums, such as the WTO, OECD, and Mercosur.
